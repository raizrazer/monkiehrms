### Visit [monkiehrms.vercel.app/](https://monkiehrms.vercel.app/) for the live demo

## For Setup:
1. npm init
2. make sure all the things are there which is on the package.json.
3. As I have us Shadcn which is component-based, you probably will have to copy all the files from the Shadcn website.
4. To set up Firebase, you only need the cloud function, firestore, and authentication. I have used react-firebase-hook for quicker implementation.
5. For cloud function, you must have to download Google Firebase SDK CLI, which is not something I would recommend, but it's cool. 
6. Used React-Hook-Form for some of the validations.
7. I didn't care for state management, but still used Context API because it's cool.
8. This should be running on vercel.
9. I guess that's pretty much it.

A Leave Management HRMS by Monkie(Raiz)

The time taken to develop the app, was 18 hours, with some short breaks in between.
As I had work most of the near weekend days, I couldn't get to start earlier.
That's why I had to do a marathon-ish writing session.

---

Let's talk about the tech stack,
NextJS, Tailwind, Shadcn,
Google Firebase(Authentication,
Cloud Function, Firestore),
Radix UI functions,
Context API(for little state management).

---

 For the front end, I have used NextJS, as it's a flavor of React with more awesome features, even tho due to the hurry I haven't thought much about practical security issues with route handling client-side ðŸ˜… but I hope you'll understand.

**First I had to do a little bit of planning because I don't really know what I doing once I start without planning. And my chances of not finishing it are very high then, So planning is crucial for me.**

It's nothing Picasso-like, it's just the general idea of where things will be and how it will look.

**Simple and Neat Login page so less distraction**
![Image of the login](https://github.com/raizrazer/monkiehrms/assets/41806230/3d230824-a28e-4486-9c71-55aa1ada9eb9)


**Sign up isn't much different, same copy-paste of the Sign to save time**

**_Once the user signs up_**

They will be welcomed with an awesome pop-up, as they have signed in with just an email and password, they can now enter their full name.

When they first join, it will just be their Email, once they enter their name, it will turn that word magically into their name, I mean it's not magic, it's just states.

As a proud employee of the company, now the user, ahm ahm the Employee can start applying leave I guess.

They can input with such cool input ways, 'shadccnnnn'.

Once they apply, they can wait for the Overlord, I mean HR or Manager to approve their request for the leave.

This will be the manager's view to approve the leaves if they choose to.

But don't worry, if you are a good boy, the HR Lord can you make a manager too.

**WITH JUST A FLICK OF THE SWITCH, VIOLA YOU CAN BE A MANAGER TOO**

So, yeah that's the assignment which I was given.
I hope you liked it, I know it's very bad inside the code, but hey 18 hours of no sleep and 3 coffee, I think I am proud of myself.

But on a serious note, things I would do differently if I had more time, like a tonne of time.
I would have made most of the action with Auth and roles, and server actions.
I would have also made the login logout more easier with some Oauth providers.
Would have used MongoDB for more complex major operations.
But hey, who cares, I enjoyed it and it was fun. Learned about Cloud Functions too, and that's a plus.
